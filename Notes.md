**Source**: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10926-020-09895-x.pdf.  
**Summary**: Ethical assessment of the impact of Machine Learning Decision Support Tools in occupational health according to frameworks from medical ethics (Beauchamp and Childress) and philosophy of technology.
Ethical dilemmas arising from opposing principles.
Effects of technology on pre-existing problems.  
**Assessment**: not practical, not math. Strong on ethics. Very relevant, important discussion on several trade-offs.  
**Topics**:  
 - Philosophy of technology.
 - Beauchamp and Childress principles.
 - Case study.
 - Type: ethical deliberation.
 - Ethical issues typical of the application (problem) and of the technology (solution).
 - Conflict individual (data privacy etc.) => non-maleficence vs group => beneficence (trade-off).
 - Trade-off privacy vs predictability.
 - Trade-off non-discrimination vs predictability. 
 - Ethical dilemmas.
