## How ML introduces trade-offs in medicine

Interestingly, the deployment of machine learning methods in the medical context introduces new trade-offs into medicine - apart from the ones present in machine learning itself. 


 - Often: human vs AI, although there might be ways around this [^1]
 - combining AI and human evaluation were shown to achieve better results than either of the two on their own 
 - Question that remains: How are the two best combined?
 - In some cases, AI tools were shown to increase sensitivity but reduce specificity 
 - maybe more AI for less experienced, less AI for more experienced? 
 - A rather philosophical trade-off: If a person is sceptical about using ml on their diagnosis, how can we trade-off a potentially better diagnosis against respecting the persons wish with possibly risking a less accurate or even wrong diagnosis?
