\subsection{Tradoffs Intro/in general}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define tradeoffs as  inherently contradictory(trival for conflict as opposed to view that tradeoffs dont exist or should be avoided)
	\item First derive mathematical formulation used in economics(pareto efficency and multi objective optimization)
	\item Talk about tradeoffs in medicine/ethics in general
	\item Then elaborate on tradeoffs in medicine and whether the mathematical formulation can/should be employed (it shouldn't be)
\end{itemize}
