% why medicine is an interesting field to clarify ethical problems, particularities

    \begin{itemize}
        \item ML is great, blah blah, historical setting, current application.
        \item Fairness problems identified in the literature.
        \item Trade-offs and moral dilemmas: algorithmic, philosophical, medical view.
        \item Peculiarities of health care as application field:
            inevitable moral dilemmas, impossibility of the ``do nothing'' solution, developed moral literature, high stakes, less readiness to sacrify performance, human comparisons.
            Allocation of positive goods might be different from prevention of harm, eg in healthcare settings. Idea: harm distribution is different from benefit distribution.
            Trying to ensure equal harms in a setting where medicine can very well solve one group's problems seems illogical.
            true predictors: ``difference does not always entail inequality. In some instances, it is appropriate to incorporate differences between identities because there is a reasonable presumption of causation \cite[e221]{Mccradden2020}''

When it comes to ethical principles and deliberations, the biomedical field already played the important role of displacing purely theoretical ethical deliberations to more concrete, unavoidable, and tangible questions.
In the 1950s and 1960s, for example, new questions about medical ethics helped moral philosophy to move away from abstract meta-ethics toward applied ethics.
Relativist, subjectivist, and psychological investigations were replaced by studies of objective culture-invariant interests.
Broad, universal moral principles were replaced by case studies coming from situations arising for example in clinical medicine.
Finally, the use of universal maxims was replaced by particular ethical considerations taking into account the roles and relationships of the actors present (for example, by recognizing the authority relationship between doctors and patients).
Poetically put, ``Medicine saved the life of ethics'' \cite{Toulmin1982}.

% research questions
\paragraph{Research questions}
\idea{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item (Where) Are trade-offs necessary? Are algorithmic trade-offs and moral dilemmas different?
        \item What are the current results in ML? Are they going in the right direction?
        \item How are trade-off situations currently handled in medical practice? What are hidden questions?
        \item Are fairness problems of ML applied to medicine new problems intrinsic to the technology, or are they inherent to medical practice?
        \item Is ``doing nothing'' really an acceptable solution?
        \item Can we implement biomedical principles in ML?
        \item What can ML learn from medical ethics?
    \end{itemize}

% methods/sources
\paragraph{Methods and sources}
\idea{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Literature search from different sources: philosophy, medical ethics, fair-ML.
        \item Theoretical reflections and linking literature sources and fields; interdisciplinary connections.
        \item Work does not propose concrete implementation solutions.
    \end{itemize}
