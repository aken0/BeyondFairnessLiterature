\subsection{Old and new problems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Main point: most problems derive from medicine;
        if only implicitly, they are already being dealt with (or ignored altogether).
        Example: practitioners learn from experience, and their experience has biased data.
    \item 1st problem introduced by ML: the unification of knowledge and strategy (decisions could become less federated).
    \item 2nd problem introduced by ML: responsibility.
    \item 3rd problem introduced by ML: trust.
    \item All those problems are NOT fairness-related.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Clarification of problems}
Main point: the mathematical rigor of ML forces us to think about those problems; this is a positive feature and not a disadvantage.

\subsection{Advantage of inaction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Positive versus negative harms: in doubt, do nothing.
    \item This reasoning is much harder to apply to critical problems as those emerging in medicine.
\end{itemize}
