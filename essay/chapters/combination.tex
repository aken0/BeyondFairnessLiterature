\subsection{Old and new problems}
% idea: most problems derive from medicine;
%       if only inherently, they are already being dealt with (or ignored altogether).
% the biggest problem introduced by ML is the unification of knowledge and strategy
% (decisions could become less federated)

\subsection{Clarification of problems}
% the mathematical rigor of ML forces us to think about those problems;
% this is a positive feature and not a disadvantage.

\subsection{Advantage of inaction}
% positive versus negative harms: in doubt, do nothing
% this reasoning is much harder to apply to critical problems as those emerging in medicine
