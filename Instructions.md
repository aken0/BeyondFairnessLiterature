The primary item of assessment for this course is a group essay. Herewith are the details. That there is considerable latitude and lack of precision is quite deliberate!

**Group size**: Work in groups of between 2 and 4 students. In exceptional cases, I will countenance individual submissions (for example for students who are still stuck overseas).  But for students who are here in Tübingen, I strongly encourage non-singletons. 4 is a hard upper limit on group size.

**Goal of essay**: The high level goal is to investigate a particular topic that has arisen in the course in some detail. I provide some example topics below, but you are at liberty (and strongly encouraged) to choose your own topic.  It should be a topic that sits within the general area of the ethical implications of machine learning; it need not be about “fairness” specifically, but it does have to relate to machine learning and its effects on people. 

You should examine the topic from a variety of perspectives, and I would expect there will be a technical (i.e. mathematical) component, as well as a broader “socio-technical” component. I do not propose to be too prescriptive in this regard, except to say that I expect a multi-dimensional perspective; as I hope is already clear, the real problems of the societal impacts of ML cannot be solved using just one single tool (or even toolkit).  

I suggest you pick something that allows you to use some of the material I presented as a departure point, rather than diving into a “greenfield” situation with no pointers.

By “essay” I simply mean a written submission. I envisage all manner of forms of writing may be appropriate, from reasoned argument, to mathematical exposition, to presentation of the results of computations and simulations.  But you need to submit a single document (as a pdf file) that contains everything. Your work should be well referenced to the literature in the field, and I expect you to go beyond the literature that I have explicitly pointed you to.

I mandate no fixed “style” for the essay. It should fit suit the topic you write about. There is no correct way to make a good essay. Below I list some attributes that I am looking for.

The topic of the course is somewhat daunting in its scale and complexity, so for your essay you should zero in on one particular aspect and examine it in considerable detail, rather than attempting to cover too wide a range.   As a guideline the breadth of topic you should aim for, imagine you are giving half to a whole lecture in this course, and your report comprises detailed notes for your presentation.

I am especially looking for your own analysis of the particular topic you choose, not a mere summary of other people’s presentations and perspectives. This is not to say I want you to discover new results. I am looking for you own assessment of existing work. Did the authors answer the “right” question? If not, why not? As should be clear by now, the sorts of questions we are considering do not have simple answers, nor single answers. A key challenge for you is what to do in the face of this complexity and plurality. 

I encourage you to think about the problem from different starting points, disciplinary perspectives and at different levels of abstraction. Grounding your topic in concrete real examples would be very helpful, rather than just dealing with generalities. But you should also be able to connect it to broader themes.

The purpose of the essay is to not merely summarise some existing knowledge on the topic of choice, but to critically examine it from multiple perspectives.  The essay must have some conclusions, but I do not mandate their form in any way. I am especially looking for new insights, and new ways of thinking about the problem; different angles to that which is the consensus view. Radical views are welcome, but all has to be supported by tightly reasoned argument.

**Expectations**:

All members of the group will get the same grade unless you argue otherwise in your submission.

There is no set length to the essay. Given this is the sole piece of assessment for the course, and that it is a group assignment, I do expect something substantial. Without being prescriptive, a guideline is 15-20 pages (not including appendices). However, I value concision, and am allergic to waffle. So padding will not help.  Clarity of writing will affect your grade.

I am especially looking for analytical rigor. “Analytical” does not solely mean mathematical, although anything that can be treated mathematically probably should be! 

Factors which I will take into account in determining a grade for the essay include:

 - **Rigor**: and solidity of your analysis. Not just opinions, but tightly reasoned arguments.
 - **Breadth**: of literature and viewpoints consulted. Note I am encouraging a narrow focus on a particular problem (do not try to solve the world) but I do want you to look at that narrow topic from a range of perspectives
 - **Quality of writing**: Clarity, concision, precision and accuracy of the writing.
 - **Sharpness**: of the conclusions.
 - **Interestingness**: Yes, do you have something interesting and perhaps different to say. Surprise me!
 - **Connection**: to broader themes, for example understanding problems arising from ML problems by leaning on earlier technologies.
 - **Diversity**: of styles of argument: not just maths; not just philosophy; not just history of technology, etc.
 - **Balance**: Ideally there will be a mixture of analysis and synthesis, and a mixture of critique and positive proposals: in the end technologists have to figure out what to do, not just talk about a problem
 - **Insightfulness**: perhaps the key challenge in our overall topic is that it is so easy to be overwhelmed by the complexity of it. I am looking for insights that allow the apparently complexity and “overwhelm” to be dealt with.

**Example topics**:

The following are starting points You will need to narrow these down, as they are still all too broad. Consider starting with a specific example, and then consider the more general problems. This the “case-study” approach (widely used at Harvard Business school). There is no particular advantage to be had in picking one of these that I list .. they are simply provided to give you a start to your own thinking.

 - Making sense of the zoo of fairness measures. Perhaps the relationship between particular measures and the implicit moral principle that justifies them.
 - Role of notions of information in ethics of ML
 - The aggregate and the individual in the ethics of ML
 - Ethical trade-offs in ML (and what to do about them)
 - How one might regulate the technology of ML (and is this advisable)
 - How to think of the technology of ML (in the light of the history of technology)
 - The limits of mathematics in understanding the ethics of ML
 - How can ML and AI more generally improve ethical outcomes (and not just be the source of harm)
 - Commonalities and differences between ML and other technologies
 - Social categories: their structure and genesis, and their importance in the ethics of ML
 - Black boxes and their virtues and problems
 - Theories of data and their implications
 - The implications of feedback loops in ML systems
 - Autonomy, problems and resolution
 - You could of course just take one of the lectures I have given as a starting point, and develop your own take and presentation on the topic; my choices are far from canonical!
 - Another possibility would be to take a recent paper (say at the FAccT conference) and use that as your departure point.
 - Significance of uncertainty in resolving societal problems arising from Machine Learning.

**Due dates**:

Title of topic, names of group members (with matriculation numbers) and a short paragraph explaining what you envisage doing (without prejudice): **1 December** (one email direct to me from each group)

Presentation of work to peers:  **3 and 4 March**. Online presentation possible.

Final submission:  **7 March (10:00am)**. I will provide submission instructions in due course.

**Support**:

I am happy to meet groups individually to discuss their potential topic before the first due date; and am happy to also meet on demand as you conduct your work.
